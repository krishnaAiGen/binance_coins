## Quick Start

### Option 1: Manual Simulation (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run manual backtest
python manual_backtest.py
```

This will:
- Simulate 30 new listing trades
- Generate realistic price scenarios
- Create a detailed CSV report
- Show comprehensive statistics

### Option 2: Real Historical Data

```bash
# Set your Binance API credentials
export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"

# Run historical backtest
python futures_listing_backtest.py
```

This will:
- Find actual new listings from the past 90 days
- Fetch real 5-minute price data
- Analyze actual market performance
- Generate detailed CSV report

## Customization

### Modify Trading Parameters

Edit the parameters in either script:

```python
self.initial_balance = 1000.0      # Starting balance
self.stop_loss_pct = 2.0           # Stop loss percentage
self.take_profit_pct = 15.0        # Take profit percentage
self.leverage = 1                  # No leverage (1x)
self.balance_percentage = 90       # % of balance to use
```

### Adjust Number of Trades

For manual backtest:
```python
results_df = backtester.run_backtest(num_trades=50)  # Test 50 trades
```

For historical backtest:
```python
results_df = backtester.run_backtest(days_back=180)  # Look back 180 days
```

## Interpreting Results

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Win Rate**: Should be >50% for profitable strategy
2. **Risk/Reward Ratio**: Average win should be >2x average loss
3. **Time to Exit**: Shorter times indicate quicker decisions
4. **Max Drawdown**: Monitor risk exposure
5. **Cumulative Return**: Overall strategy performance

### Red Flags

- Win rate <40%
- Average loss > Average win
- High percentage of 24h timeouts
- Consistently negative returns across scenarios

## Limitations

### Manual Backtest
- Synthetic data may not reflect real market conditions
- Scenarios are simplified representations
- No liquidity or slippage considerations

### Historical Backtest
- Limited to available historical data
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- API rate limits may affect data collection
- Market conditions change over time

## Tips for Better Backtesting

1. **Run Multiple Tests**: Test with different parameters
2. **Analyze Scenarios**: Understand which market conditions work best
3. **Consider Slippage**: Real trading has execution delays
4. **Factor in Fees**: Add trading fees to calculations
5. **Test Different Timeframes**: Try different analysis periods
6. **Validate with Paper Trading**: Test with real market conditions

## Next Steps

After backtesting:

1. **Analyze Results**: Understand the strategy's strengths and weaknesses
2. **Optimize Parameters**: Adjust SL/TP levels based on results
3. **Paper Trade**: Test with real market data before live trading
4. **Risk Management**: Set position sizing based on backtest results
5. **Monitor Performance**: Compare live results with backtest expectations

## Disclaimer

Backtesting results are not indicative of future performance. Past results do not guarantee future profits. Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss. Always trade responsibly and never risk more than you can afford to lose.
