# ===== TRADING STRATEGY EXPLANATION =====
# New Strategy:
# 1. Bot detects new listing
# 2. Waits 15 seconds after detection
# 3. Calculates trade amount: Available Balance Ã— BALANCE_PERCENTAGE
# 4. Attempts to place ONE trade of calculated amount every 15 seconds for up to 8 attempts (2 minutes total)
# 5. STOPS attempting once trade is successfully placed (won't place multiple trades)
# 6. Each successful trade has automatic Stop Loss and Take Profit
# 7. No order splitting - trade is placed as a single order
# 8. Handles Binance restrictions in first 15-30 seconds after listing
#
# Example: If available balance = $1000 and BALANCE_PERCENTAGE = 10, trade amount = $100
